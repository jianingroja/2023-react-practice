## Accomplishment counter

When looking at react at 2023 I feel familiar, at the same time the need of re-learning.

I don't want to build yet another 'how many times you have clicked the button' counter for react practicing project, so I improvised a bit. I have the habit of keeping a simple calendar notebook and writing down a list of things I need to do in the day, not that all the days I finish everything, but when I do finish one of them, I like to check mark it and the sense of accomplishment is what I really enjoyed and feel encouraged by.

So I figured I can make a digital one for me, to practice react, and at the end of the day, to double that sense of joy.
